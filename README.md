# Description

A simplified version of the mobile game Snake. A point on a board is moving over the screen,eating other points while getting faster and trying to not hit the board edge.

# Instructions to play

The player Character is moving automatically as soon as you push an arrow key. The direction can be controlled but not the movement itself. Collect the appearing dots as food on the screen and score points. The Character gets faster after every scoring and the game is over when colliding with the edge.
